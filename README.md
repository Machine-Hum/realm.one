Realm one is an open source tile based game written in Rust using the Amethyst
game engine. It is the first game that will be integrated into the distributed
MMO platform [Worlds](https://github.com/o7-machinehum/Worlds). Following the
implementation anyone will be able to fork this repository and add to the
universe!

## Running
You need to configure either metal or vulkan. This is shown in the cargo.toml file.

### Client

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Machine-Hum/realm.one
cd realm.one
```

Setup the config file resources/config.ron, public server is **18.223.212.117:3457** right now 
```rust 
AppConfig(
    server_ip: "18.220.126.218:3457",
    client_ip: "Depricated, Can be blank",
    player_name: "YourName - Change this!",
)
